# gravity-simulation-py
My attempt to write some gravitational forces model using python.
All the code one can find in gravity.py file.
I used imageio, matplotlib, numpy, pandas, math and random libraries. First four of thouse should be installed.
Not a "real phisics" computaitons, but "look phisics-like" ones. Maybe someday I will do some research in Physics and get this code into right "shape".
Have a nice day!
